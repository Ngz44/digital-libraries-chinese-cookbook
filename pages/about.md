## About The Context of the Collection
This site hosts a digitized collection of several pages from several U.S. published cookbooks from the 1900-1950's.Most of these cookbooks were primarily obtained through digitized collections such as [Food and Drink in History](https://www-foodanddrink-amdigital-co-uk.proxyiub.uits.iu.edu/). This collection aims to be an exploration of the perceptions and representations of the Chinese within the U.S. using Chinese cuisine cookbooks with the illustrations and languages used within them.

## Create your own Metadata

To create metadata compatible with this CollectionBuilder-Sheets instance the best way to get started is to make of copy of our template in Google Drive:

[CollectionBuilder Metadata Template](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Uv9ytll0hysMOH1j-VL1lZx6PWvc1zf3L35sK_4IuzI/copy?usp=sharing){:.btn .btn-outline-primary}
{:.text-center}

Alternatively, you can [download the template CSV]({{ '/assets/metadata-template.csv' | relative_url }}) and work on your local machine.
We suggest editing your CSV using [LibreOffice](https://www.libreoffice.org/) Calc, [OpenRefine](https://openrefine.org/), or Google Sheets (and do not suggest using Excel, since Excel's CSV output is not correctly formatted).

Describe your items in your copy of the template, following the [Metadata Guidelines]({{ '/metadata.html' | relative_url }}). 

Once you have items added you can test your metadata by clicking the "Change the Metadata" button above.
