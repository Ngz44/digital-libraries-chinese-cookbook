## About the Collection
This site hosts a digitized collection of several pages from several U.S. published cookbooks from the 1900-1950's.Most of these cookbooks were primarily obtained through digitized collections such as [Food and Drink in History](https://www-foodanddrink-amdigital-co-uk.proxyiub.uits.iu.edu/). This collection aims to be an exploration of the perceptions and representations of the Chinese within the U.S. using Chinese cuisine cookbooks with the illustrations and languages used within them. During my studies in completing my B.A. in History, I was interested in the cultural impacts and perceptions of diasporic communities by surrounding larger communities/groups. This interest continued to lead me to pursue that form of research through the lenses of cookbooks of the past.

Alternatively, you can [download the template CSV]({{ '/assets/metadata-template.csv' | relative_url }}) and work on your local machine.
We suggest editing your CSV using [LibreOffice](https://www.libreoffice.org/) Calc, [OpenRefine](https://openrefine.org/), or Google Sheets (and do not suggest using Excel, since Excel's CSV output is not correctly formatted).

Describe your items in your copy of the template, following the [Metadata Guidelines]({{ '/metadata.html' | relative_url }}). 

Once you have items added you can test your metadata by clicking the "Change the Metadata" button above.
